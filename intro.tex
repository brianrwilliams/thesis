\chapter{Introduction}

Here is a summary of the main results of this thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The renormalization group flow of holomorphic theories in any dimension is finite at one-loop.
We show that there exists a regularization scheme based on heat kernels that provides a one-loop renormalization that requires no counterterms. 
Further, for holomorphic theories on $\CC^d$ we exhibit a general formula for the obstruction to satisfying the quantum master equation as a sum over wheels of valence $(d+1)$. 

\item For any complex manifold $X$ we prove that the space of quantizations of the holomorphic $\sigma$-model of maps $\CC^d \to X$ is nonempty if and only if $\ch_{d+1}(T^{1,0}X) = 0$. 
In the case the component of the Chern character does vanish we construct an effective BV theory using Gelfand-Kazhdan formal geometry.
We proceed to provide a complete description of the local operators of the theory using factorization algebras.

\item We classify local extensions of the holomorphic current algebra associated to a Lie algebra $\fg$ and the Lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields on any complex manifold.
In the case of the current algebra, we extract from the enveloping factorization algebra a dg Lie algebra extending the sphere algebra of $\fg$.
In the one-dimensional case this recovers the usual affine algebra.
Further, using techniques developed in item (1) we prove a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem over the formal moduli space of $G$-bundles using techniques of Feynman diagrams and BV quantization.
